## 🧪 Passwords Tested

Five passwords were created with varying complexities:

- `apple123` (Weak)
- `Apple@2024` (Medium)
- `1aB!xY9#` (Strong)
- `correcthorsebatterystaple` (Strong)
- `X@9!z#QbW3^r$7&Kj*` (Very Strong)

Each password was tested on tools like:
- [Password Monster](https://passwordmonster.com)
- [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com)

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Longer passwords** (12+ characters) offer better resistance to brute-force attacks.
- **Mixing character types** (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols) increases entropy.
- **Passphrases** (random word combinations) are user-friendly yet strong.
- **Randomness** is more effective than simple substitutions (like `@` for `a`).

## 📌 Security Best Practices

- Use a password manager.
- Avoid reusing passwords across accounts.
- Use 2FA where possible.
- Avoid dictionary words or personal data.
- Regularly update passwords.

| Dictionary Attack | Uses a list of known passwords and common patterns.           |
| Phishing          | Tricks users into revealing passwords.                        |
| Keylogging        | Captures keystrokes to steal passwords.                       |
| Credential Stuffing| Tries leaked passwords on multiple accounts.                |
