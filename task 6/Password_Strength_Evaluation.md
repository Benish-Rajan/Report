## üß™ 2. Password Strength Check Results

Checked using [Password Monster](https://passwordmonster.com) and [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com/).

| Password ID | Password               | Score / Feedback                               |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| P1          | apple123               | Weak - Easily guessable                        |
| P2          | Apple@2024             | Medium - Better, but still could be brute-forced|
| P3          | 1aB!xY9#               | Strong - Hard to crack, good symbol use        |
| P4          | correcthorsebatterystaple | Strong - High entropy due to length         |
| P5          | X@9!z#QbW3^r$7&Kj*     | Very Strong - Very high entropy and randomness |

## ‚úÖ 3. Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use **12+ characters** for stronger protection.
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid **common words** and predictable patterns.
- Use **passphrases** (random words strung together).
- Don‚Äôt reuse passwords across multiple sites.
- Consider using a **password manager** to store complex passwords.

---

## üí° 4. Tips Learned

- **Length > complexity**: A longer passphrase can outperform a short, complex one.
- Randomness is key: Predictable substitutions like `@` for `a` aren‚Äôt strong enough.
- Passwords should not be personally relatable (e.g., birthdays, pet names).
- Avoid dictionary words unless they're part of a long phrase.

## üõ°Ô∏è 5. Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force        | Tries every combination; time increases with password length & complexity.  |
| Dictionary Attack  | Uses lists of common passwords/words to guess easily guessable passwords.   |
| Credential Stuffing| Uses leaked username/password combos to try logins on multiple sites.       |
| Phishing           | Tricks users into revealing passwords.                                      |
| Keylogging         | Malware records keystrokes to capture passwords.                            |

## üîí 6. Password Complexity vs. Security

- Password complexity **directly increases resistance** to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
- **Long, random passwords** take exponentially more time to crack.
- Combining **different character types** makes pattern recognition harder.
- **Passphrases** are a user-friendly alternative that still offer strong protection.

üßæ **Conclusion:**  
Password strength is a critical layer of security. Strong passwords must be **long**, **random**, and **unique**. Pairing this with good digital hygiene (2FA, password managers) is key to staying secure.
